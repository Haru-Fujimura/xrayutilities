python ..... holds an installable python module 
src ........ source directory for the C-library
tools ...... sources and binaries for tools (executable programs)

INSTALLATION
============
Installing xrutils is a two step process
1.) installing required third party software
1.) build and install the C-library libxrutils.so
2.) install the python module

Building and installing the C library
-------------------------------------
xrutils uses SCons to build and install C code. Installation
of libxrutils.so requires two steps
-> compile the library by simply typing 
   $>scons
   or
   $>scons debug=1
   to build with "-g -O0"
-> install the library and tools with 
   $>scons install --prefix=<path to install directory>
-> the documentation can be built with
   $>scons doc

The --prefix option sets the root directory for the installation.
Tools are installed under <prefix>/bin the library under
<prefix>/lib. 

Installing the Python module
----------------------------
Tow possible installation procedures for the Python module are supported
1.) system wide installtion in the systems Python installation
2.) user local installation

In the first case a simple
>python setup.py install
will install the python module in the standard directory where Python looks for 
third party modules.
For user local installation use
>python setup.py install --home=<install path>
In this case the module is installed under <install path>/lib/python. 

If you have installed the Python package in a directory unknown to your 
local Python distribution (usually the case for user local installation) 
you have to tell Python where to look for the Package. There are several 
ways how to do this:

-) add the directory where the package is installed to your 
   PYTHONPATH environment variable.

-) add the path to sys.path in the .pythonrc file placed in your home 
   directory.

   import sys
   sys.path.append("path to the xrutils package")

-) simply apply the previous method in every script where you want to 
   use the xrutils package before importing the package:

   import sys
   sys.path.append("path to the xrutils package")
   import xrutils
