/****h* XRayUtils/Detector
 *  NAME
 *     Detector - functions and data types to handle detector data
 *  DESCRIPTION
 *     The Detector module contains functions and data types used to 
 *     handle detector data. Currently 1D detectors (like PSD) and 
 *     2D detectors (like CCD cameras) are supported. 
 *
 *     The data is stored in native double arrays - no special data 
 *     structures are used. This should keep everything as simple as 
 *     possible. 
 *
 *     A few words about how 2D data is stored in a 1D array. Consider a CCD 
 *     data set of NX x NY points. Where NX is the number of columns while
 *     NY is the number of rows. 2D data is stored in an 1D array with 
 *     column index varying fastest. To obtain the data value on pixle i,j where 
 *     i is the row index in j the column index, the following notation must 
 *     be used data[j+i*NX].
