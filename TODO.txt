implement alternative call of line_cut function with Gridder2D object instead
of data... basically overload the function if this is possible in python?

9.2.2012

make the use of pthreads optional

DK: the new config should be used by the whole python package were necessary. 
maybe much more config options should be added, this needs discussion.
One idea would be the nthreads (number of threads used by the gridder) variable...

pyunit tests could be implemented to test the core functionality of the
xrutils package. 
Therefore example files for each io module should be included.
