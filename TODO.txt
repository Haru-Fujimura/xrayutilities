* check if energy is in range of tabulated data for optical constant
  calculation

27.3.2012

implement alternative call of line_cut function with Gridder2D object instead
of data... basically overload the function if this is possible in python?

24.3.2012

install examples and documentation

9.2.2012

make the use of pthreads optional

3.11.2010

DK: the new config should be used by the whole python package were necessary. 
maybe much more config options should be added, this needs discussion.
One idea would be the nthreads (number of threads used by the gridder) variable...

3.09.2010

DK: from the refractive index the angle for total reflection for GID can be
calculated. This should be implemented somewhere.

discussion Eugen, Dominik

* calculation of chi_h should be implemented according to Lugovskaya, Stepanov
  Sov. Phys. Crystallogr. 36(4) 1991
* include Debye-Waller factor into calculation of the structurefactor
* a example/test folder should be created. two possibilities exist for its
  exact purpose:
  * templates of scripts could be hold there for the user
  * pyunit tests could be implemented to test the core functionality of the
    xrutils package. 
  Therefore example files for each io module should be included.
