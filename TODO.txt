To Do

10.6.2013

* remove files created by build checks
* adapt changes of c-code in python calls (qconversion, gridder?)
* create test scripts 

27.3.2012

implement alternative call of line_cut function with Gridder2D object instead
of data... basically overload the function if this is possible in python?

9.2.2012

make the use of pthreads optional
nthreads (number of threads used by the gridder) should be in the config

pyunit tests could be implemented to test the core functionality of the
xrutils package. 
Therefore example files for each io module should be included.
