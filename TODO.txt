DK: add license note to every source file, check license of database file
conversion to GIT

3.11.2010

DK: the new config should be used by the whole python package were necessary.
maybe much more config options should be added, this needs discussion.
One idea would be the nthreads (number of threads used by the gridder) variable...

3.09.2010

DK: from the refractive index the angle for total reflection for GID can be
calculated. This should be implemented somewhere.

discussion Eugen, Dominik

* calculation of chi_h should be implemented according to Lugovskaya, Stepanov
  Sov. Phys. Crystallogr. 36(4) 1991
* include Debye-Waller factor into calculation of the structurefactor
* a example/test folder should be created. two possibilities exist for its
  exact purpose:
  * templates of scripts could be hold there for the user
  * pyunit tests could be implemented to test the core functionality of the
    xrutils package.
  Therefore example files for each io module should be included.
* natural constants should be handled in a general way or imported from scipy
  as scipy is anyhow already needed as a dependancy this would not add any
  additional dependancies.
* the manual should be updated to include details about the calculation of
  material properties, or suiteable references
  and furthermore details about the configuration of the QConversion class
  should be added (Examples with pictures of the Seifert, and Rotating anode)
* old/not functioning/not uses code should be removed from trunk
