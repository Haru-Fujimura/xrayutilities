DK: from the refractive index the angle for total reflection for GID can be
calculated. This should be implemented somewhere.

27.08.2010

DK: add support for a real coplanar diffraction experiment class and a second
class for non coplanar diffraction which uses chi and phi as additional
angles

discussion Eugen, Dominik

* calculation of chi_h should be implemented according to Lugovskaya, Stepanov
  Sov. Phys. Crystallogr. 36(4) 1991
* include Debye-Waller factor into calculation of the structurefactor
* a new (alternative) interface for Q2Ang should be developed which includes
  the possibilty to consider the refractive shift.
* a config class should be added which handles general configuration options
  such as the verbosity level of the package, standard wavelength/energy,
  standard angular format (degree, radians)
  In a second step this class should be feeded with values which it reads from
  a config file (e.g. .xrutils.conf)
* a example/test folder should be created. two possibilities exist for its
  exact purpose:
  * templates of scripts could be hold there for the user
  * pyunit tests could be implemented to test the core functionality of the
    xrutils package. 
  Therefore example files for each io module should be included.
* natural constants should be handled in a general way or imported from scipy
  as scipy is anyhow already needed as a dependancy this would not add any 
  additional dependancies.
* the manual should be updated to include details about the calculation of  
  material properties, or suiteable references
  and furthermore details about the configuration of the QConversion class
  should be added (Examples with pictures of the Seifert, and Rotating anode)
* the use of the transform method of the experimental class should be unified
* old/not functioning/not uses code should be removed from trunk
* Ang2Q help should be added to the experiment classes, via some emtpy   
  function which is anyhow overwritten during initialization
